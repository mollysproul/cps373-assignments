## Network Topology

### Getting Started
Unlike the prior assignments, this assignment does not rely on any third party libraries.

There is only a single program to compile and run (`main`).

### Next steps
1. Create a separate function in `main.cpp` for each of the 3 network topologies in the pdf.
2. Determine the forwarding tables for each topology (either by hand or with code).
3. Add timing code to indicate how long it takes for the messages to reach their destinations.
4. Send the supplied messages through each network.
5. Record your observations in a `writeup.txt` file.
